  "text": "The Pittsburgh Home Rule Charter, Article One, Home Rule Powers - Definitions is the foundational section of Pittsburgh's city charter that establishes the city's powers of self-governance and defines key terms used throughout the charter. This article sets the legal framework for what the city government can and cannot do under Pennsylvania's home rule law. Recent proposed amendments would add new sections to this article, including restrictions on using the charter amendment process beyond the city's lawful authority and prohibitions on discrimination in city business. The Home Rule Charter as a whole governs how Pittsburgh operates independently from state control in local matters, with Article One serving as the definitional and powers foundation.",
